September 2021

lr-handy
- An Atari Lynx emulator
- This needs the Lynx BIOS file to be placed in the same directory as your ROMS. (lynxboot.img)
- Tested it with Toki and Xybots - seemed to work ok with both.

lr-gpsp
- A Gameboy Advance Emulator.
- Contributor davidfgnet has once again made several bugfix commits to this emulator in the last month, so thought it was worth compiling a new build.
- As usual you will need a GBA BIOS file to be placed in the ROMS folder.

lr-cap32
- Amstrad CPC Emulator.
- Contributor DavidSkywalker revamped the Virtual Keyboard and committed his changes yesterday!  The previous virtual keyboard, based on the Nuklear GUI, was unusable with my LeapsterGS in particular - the default size was way too small, and even expanding to its biggest size meant you still couldn't even make out the keys!
- David's virtual keyboard is much much better, can see all the keys and is laid out like a proper CPC keyboard!  I have tested and it works well - still room for some improvement such as opacity etc so that you can see what's behind it, and also you have to use a mouse pointer to select the keys but thankfully this is nice and quick using the LeepsterGS directional pad!
- Tested this build with the game R-Type, all seemed ok.
