lr-handy
- An Atari Lynx emulator
- This needs the Lynx BIOS file to be placed in the same directory as your ROMS. (lynxboot.img)
- Tested it with Toki and Xybots - seemed to work ok with both.

lr-gpsp
- A Gameboy Advance Emulator.
- Contributor davidfgnet has once again made several bugfix commits to this emulator in the last month, so thought it was worth compiling a new build.
- As usual you will need a GBA BIOS file to be placed in the ROMS folder.
