# libretro-cores-leap
 
A repository for compiled libretro cores specifically for Leapfrog devices (LeapPad / Leapster).

These can be used with Retroleap (see https://github.com/mac2612/retroleap)

I will periodically compile and add cores based on releases, or git snapshots (these will be dated).

Please refer to each folder for Cores and the readme file for any notes.
